<salute>Preamble and Joint Resolution of the Legislature of the State of Texas, requesting the Senators and Representatives, of Texas in the Congress of the United States, to urge the passage of a law for the payment of the volunteers called out from this State under the requisition of Col. S. R. Curtis.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, during the progress of the present war with Mexico, several requisitions have been made upon this State for troops, which have been promptly responded to by our citizens:</p>
<p>And whereas, those who went out under the call based upon <pb n="7" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="7" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the requisition of Col. S. R. Curtis, (then commanding at Camar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />go,) for two thousand six months mounted riflemen, to meet an existing emergency, have not received pay for their services:</p>
<p>And whereas, these men by their promptness in hastening to the place of rendezvous&#8212;in organizing themselves into a regiment&#8212; and in marching for the seat of war, under the almost universal impression that the state of affairs in Mexico was such that their services were most anxiously desired, have shown themselves pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed of that true spirit of zealous patriotism, in which rests in a great degree, the power of free governments to render themselves invincible without standing armies:</p>
<p>And whereas, the officers and members of that regiment incurred a very considerable expense in purchasing horses and arms for that campaign:</p>
<p>And whereas, their loss, particularly in horses, was necessarily considerable; from the fact that they received no forage, except for a few days at San Antonio, and that the country was generally burnt over by fires and drought, so that they were almost without grass&#8212;their horses becoming thereby comparatively valueless&#8212; and that many of them, for want of means, were compelled to sacri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fice them at sale, in order to be able to return home:</p>
<p>And whereas, it is necessary that the just claims of these troops to compensation should be presented to the Congress of the United States, therefore:</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it unanimously resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That our Senators and Representatives be requested to urge upon the Congress of the United States, to make such an appropriation as will secure to that regiment a just compensation for their services and losses.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. Be it further resolved, That his excellency the Gover<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nor be requested to forward a copy of this preamble and resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions to each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress, to be by them laid before their respective Houses.</p>

<p>Whereas in the opinion of the Legislature of the State of Texas, all Courts are ordained and established for the general good of the people, and the well being of society:</p>

<p>And, whereas, the present Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Texas, has since his appointment to that important office remained but a small part of the time within his said District, Therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1.

</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That in the opinion of this body, the existing war between the United States and Mexico, was rendered necessary, and was brought on by the acts and outrages of the latter; that its moral responsibilities therefore, must devolve upon that nation alone; and that it would be, under such circumstances, derogatory to the rights and dignity of the United States, to surrender to Mexico, by treaty or otherwise, the Provinces or States of Mexico which she has been compelled to take possession of, and now holds, by right of conquest, unless Mexico shall make complete and full in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demnity for the injuries and aggressions which provoked the war, and also for the expenses incurred by the United States in the prosecution of it.</p>
<p>Sec. 2.

<salute>Joint Resolution, on the &#8220;Proviso,&#8221; Slavery, the Tariff, and the War against Mexico.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That any attempt on the part of the Congress of the Uni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="133" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="133" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>ted States to interfere with the domestic and internal policy of the States or Territories, is unwarranted by the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of the rights of the States. The &#8220;Proviso,&#8221; if submitted to, would prevent the slaveholding States from enjoying the full benefits of any territory which may be here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after acquired, by the United States. The Constitution of the United States recognizes slavery, as one of our domestic institu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions, and we acknowledge no right to abolish it, but that which belongs to the slaveholding States themselves. We will not submit to any law, which prohibits the citizens of the Southern States, from taking their property to any territory which may be acquired from Mexico. We are willing to submit to the compromises of the Constitution, but we will never submit to a usurpation of power which robs us of our rights.</p>
<p>Resolved further, That we deny the right of the Congress of the United States, to pass any law prohibiting any State, that may hereafter he admitted into the Union, from coming in, either with or without slavery, as the popular voice of such State may deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mine. This principle we will not yield.</p>
<p>Resolved further, That the just and equitable mode of raising revenue, is to levy a tariff on the advalorem principle, for purposes of revenue, as contra distinguished from the protective policy. That we believe that the tariff of 1846, will yield more revenue to the United States, than could be derived from the tariff of 1842, and that the former is at the same time, less burdensome to the people than the latter would be; and believing it to be a cardinal principle of government, that the burdens should be equally borne by all classes of the community, we hope that the general principles of the tariff of 1846, will not be altered. We are willing to pay for &#8220;Revenue,&#8221; but not for &#8220;Protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Resolved further, That we consider the war with Mexico, as necessary to the vindication of our national honor, as a war which was brought on by Mexico, by making an attack upon the army of the United States, at a time when the Mexican gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment expected to destroy that gallant band&#8212;who have added fresh lustre to the American name. After the bad faith, which has characterized the Mexicans, we have nothing to hope for, but that justice which we must compel them to grant by force of arms. We recommend, therefore, a vigorous prose<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cution of the war, until we obtain full indemnity for the wrongs and injuries done us. If it be necessary to appropriate <pb n="134" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="134" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>some of the most valuable portions of Mexican Territory, we rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ommend that it be done. We should never give up California. We should secure a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, across the Isthmus, for all time to come. We should take possession of the Mexican ports, collect her revenues, and levy a tax upon all the property of the nation, to support our armies. As long as Mexico compels us to keep an army there, we should make her support it.</p>
<p>Resolved further, That our Senators he instructed, and our Rep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />resentatives in Congress he requested, to support the principles set forth in the foregoing resolutions, and to use all just and Constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional means to resist encroachments upon the rights of the slave<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />holding States.</p>
<p>Resolved further, That the Governor he requested to forward &#38; copy of these Resolutions to the President of the United States, the Governors of each of the States in the Union, and to our Sena<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors and Representatives in Congress, under the seal of the State, and with his signature of approval.</p>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That whenever any Sheriff or other lawful officer shall levy a writ of execution, sequestration or attachment, upon any personal prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, and such property or any part thereof, shall be claimed by any person who is not a party to such writ, such person or his agent may make oath in writing, before some Justice of the Peace, of the county where the levy was made, that such claim is made in good faith, and present such oath in writing, to the officer who made such levy, and may also execute and deliver to the officer who made such levy, his bond, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved of by such officer, payable, to the plaintiff in such writ, for an amount equal to double the value of the property so claimed, to be assessed by such officer, conditioned that the party making such claim, in ease he fails to establish his right to such property, shall return the same to the officer making such levy or his successor, and shall also pay to the plaintiff in such writ, all damages that may be awarded against him, by the Jury, on the trial of the right to such property; whereupon it shall be the duty of the officer, receiving such oath and bond, to deliver such prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, so claimed, to the person so claiming it.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That whenever any person shall claim property; and shall make the oath, and give the bond, as provided for in the first section of this act, if the writ, under which such levy was made, was issued by any Justice of the Peace or Court of the county where such levy was made, the Sheriff or other officer, receiving such oath and bond, shall endorse on the writ, that such claim has been made, and oath and bond given, stating by whom, and shall also endorse on such bond, the value of the property, as assessed by himself, and shall forthwith return such bond and oath to the Justice or the Clerk of the Court from which the said writ issued; but if the writ, under which such levy was made, was issued by any Justice of the Peace or Court of another county, than that in which such levy was <pb n="141" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="141" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>made, then the Sheriff or other officer, receiving such oath and bond, shall endorse on such bond, the value of the property as as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed by himself, and shall forthwith return such bond and oath, with a copy of the writ, to some Justice of the Peace of his county, if the writ was issued by a Justice, or to the District Court of his county, if the writ was issued by any other authority than a Justice of the Peace; and he shall also endorse on the writ, that such claim has been made, and oath and bond given, stating by whom, and to what Justice or Court, the bond has been returned, and at what time it was so returned, and shall forthwith return such writ to the Justice or Court from which it issued.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That whenever any oath and bond, for the trial of the right of property, shall be returned to any Court other than a Justice&#8217;s Court, as provided for in the second section of this act, it shall be the duty of the Clerk of such Court, to docket the same in the name of the plaintiff in the writ, as the plaintiff, and the claimant of the property as defendant, and at the first term of the Court thereafter, if both parties appear, the Court shall direct an issue to be made up between the parties and tried by a Jury as in other cases, but if the plaintiff appears and the defendant fails to appear, or neglects or refuses to join issue under the directions of the Court, within the time prescribed for pleading, the plaintiff shall have judgment by default as in other cases. If the plaintiff does not appear at the said first term, the case shall be continued to the next term, when if he appears, the like proceedings may be had as at the said first term, but if he does not then appear on or be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore the first day of said term, he shall be non suited, provided that in all such cases, if the property so claimed, was taken from the possession of the claimant, then the burden of proof shall be upon the plaintiff in the original writ of execution, sequestration or attachment; but if the property so claimed, was taken from the possession of any other person, than such claimant, then the bur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />den of proof shall be upon such claimant.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That whenever any oath and bond for the trial of the right of property, shall be returned, under the provisions of the second section of this act to any Justice of the Peace, the plaintiff in the writ, may, at any time, apply to such Justice for a citation against such claimant, and on the return thereof executed, a trial of the right of such property shall be liad be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore such Justice in like manner as other trials are had before <pb n="142" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="142" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>Justices of the Peace, but if the property was taken from the pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of the claimant, the burden of proof shall be on the plain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tiff, and if it was taken from the possession of the defendant in such writ, or any other person than the claimant, the burden of proof shall be on the claimant.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That in all trials of the right of property under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act, if the claimant shall fail to establish his right to the property, the Court or Justice trying the same shall give judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment against all the obligors in the claimants bond for ten per cent damages, on the value of the property claimed, unless such value is greater, than the amount claimed under the writ, by virtue of which such property was levied, in which case, such damages shall be on the amount claimed under said writ.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That in all trials of the right of property, under the provisions of this act, in any County other than that in which the writ issued under which the levy was made, the copy of the writ, required to he returned by the Sheriff or other officer, making the levy, shall be received in evidence, in like manner as the original could be.</p>

<p>Sec. 8. That a claim made to property, under the provisions of this act, shall operate as a release, by the claimant, of all dam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ages against the Sheriff or other officer who levied on such prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty.</p>
<p>Sec. 9.

<opener>
<salute>To his Excellency, the President of the United States:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The Memorial of the Legislature of the State of Texas, in behalf of sundry citizens whose property was destroyed by the armies of Mexico, during the revolution.</p>
<p>Your memorialists would most respectfully represent unto your Excellency: That, as might have been anticipated, the calamities of the Texian revolution, fell unequally upon particular individu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />als, and the most exposed sections of the country; that in the line of march adopted by the Mexican armies in 1836, the property of every citizen was seized upon and appropriated by a rapacious sold<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />iery, evincing at every step the wanton ruin incident to barbarian warfare: And after the capture of Santa Anna, and the defeat of his forces by the issue of the battle of San Jacinto, the Mexican gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment continued to carry on a still more barbarous and unjusti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fiable warfare, by making predatory incursions into the country: These incursions consisting of frequent and unexpected irruptions, promiscuous plunder and rapid retreats, differed in no respect from those of the savage Indians, by whom we were then surrounded: These had their origin in the basest conceivable motives, to wit: In the desire to gratify their revenge and their rapacity, motives which every civilized nation upon the globe would be ashamed to avow. So unexpected were these descents, and so rapid their re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />treats, that it was impossible to prepare for their reception or to punish them for numerous injuries which they wantonly inflicted.</p>
<p>The condition of Texas at the time of annexation, was such as to leave no doubt as to her ability to maintain her independence. This was not only conceded, but positively avowed on the part of the United States, during every stage of the negotiations which preceded and led to annexation. It is further apparent, from the implied acknowledgment of Mexico herself, contained in her proffer to acknowledge our separate nationality: And hence it would be but reasonable to conclude, that Texas would ere long have been in a position to force from Mexico the ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />knowledgement of her independence, and to cause to be inserted, <pb n="217" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="217" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>a stipulation in the treaty of peace providing for the full indemnity of her injured citizens. She divested herself of all these advant<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ages and rights, when she surrendered her separate existence and became a member of the American Union. And since, so far as Texas is concerned, this may be regarded as the same unfinished war; since during its pendency, her sovereignty in a national point of view has merged in that of the United States. Since the latter has assumed the position of the former in relation to it, surely she should feel the same moral obligation resting upon her, to provide for the remuneration of those injured citizens, just as though the war had been carried on from its commencement by the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the United States. This, Texas would have had the power to do, and would have been in duty bound to do, had she terminated the war as a separate and independent nation. But the relations of Texas have so changed by annexation, that she can now make no treaty stipulations on the subject; and unless their remuneration is provided for by the government of the United States, they will never be remunerated at all. It would surely not be just to leave unprovided for the meritorious claims of those citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens, who have been longest engaged in the war&#8212;who have shared its dangers and borne its calamities.</p>
<p>Aside from these considerations, the inducements held out to Texas, and the obligation assumed on the part of the United States, continued by the correspondence during the pendency of the prof<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fer for annexation, clearly show, that the rights and interests of the Texian sufferers will not be forgotten, nor regarded with indiffer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence by the Executive government of the Union, and especially by your Excellency. Taught by the pledges then given, that those rights would be held sacredly and effectually protected, whenever the occasion might arise, your memorialists pray that your Excel<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lency will take into consideration, the subject matter of this memo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rial, and cause its object to be carried out by proper provisions in the contemplated treaty with Mexico.</p>
<p>Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the Governor be and he is hereby requested to transmit copies of this memorial and resolution, to the President of the United States, and to each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That the twenty-fourth section of said act shall be, and is amended, so that it shall hereafter read as follows, viz: Section 24 Be it further enacted, That the plaintiff, wishing to controvert the garnishees answer, may do so, by making oath, that he believes the same to be incorrect, whereupon, if the garnishee resides in the county in which the original suit is brought, an issue shall be formed under the direction of the court, and tried as in other suits: but if the garnishee is a resident of any other county, the plaintiff may file a copy of the judgment in the original suit, together with a copy of said controverted answer and oath, in any court of the county, in which the garnishee resides, that has jurisdiction of an amount equal to that demanded in the original suit, when it shall be the duty of the Justice of the Peace, or the clerk of the court, in whose office such copies are filed, to docket the same as an original suit, and issue a citation against the garni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />shee, as in other suits: and upon the return of such citation served, an issue shall be formed under the direction of the court, or Justice of the Peace, as the case may be, and tried in like manner, as the <pb n="478" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="40" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>same might have been done in the court in which the original suit was brought, if the garnishee had been a resident of the county when such original suit was brought.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Be it further enacted, That two other sections shall be and they are hereby added to said act, to read as follows, viz: Sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion 30.

Sec. 31. That in all cases, where a judicial at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tachment shall hereafter issue, if at any time before the trial, the defendant by himself, or by his attorney, shall appear and answer the suit, he may on motion, have said attachment set aside and vacated, and the property attached, released; but nothing in this thirty-firse section, shall in any manner effect, or control the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings on original attachments.</p>

<p>Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the territories of the United States, belong to the several States com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posing the Union, and are held by them as their joint and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mon property.</p>
<p>Resolved, That Congress, as the joint agent and representative of the Union, has no right to make any law, or do any act what<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever, that shall directly or by its effects, make any discrimination between the States of this Union, by which any of them shall be deprived of its full and equal right in any territory of the United States, acquired or to be acquired.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the enactment of any law which should directly or by its effects, deprive the citizens of any of the States of this Union, from emigrating with their property into any of the terri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tories of the United States, will make such discrimination, and would therefore be a violation of the constitution, and the rights of the States, from which such citizens emigrated, and in deroga<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of that perfect equality which belongs to them as members of the Union, and would tend directly to subvert the Union itself.</p>
<p>Resolved, That as a fundamental principle in our political creed, a people in forming a constitution have the unconditional right to form and adopt the government, which they may think best cal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />culated to secure liberty, prosperity and happiness; and that in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formity thereto, no other, condition is imposed by the Federal Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitution on a State, except that its constitution be republican, and that the imposition of any other by Congress, would not only be in violation of the constitution, but in direct conflict with the princi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple upon which our political system rests.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the abolition of slavery in the District of Colum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bia, involving as it does, an exercise of power not granted by the constitution, and designed as it is, as a means of affecting the insti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tution of slavery in the States, and against which it is aimed as a blow, should be resisted on the part of the South, by whatever means are best adapted to the protection of the constitution, the defence of herself, and the preservation of the Union.</p>
<p>Resolved, That knowing no party names or political divisions upon questions involving in their nature and consequences, the character, property and political existence of those we represent, we are prepared to make common cause with our sister States of <pb n="532" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="94" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the South in defence of the Federal Constitution; that our rights being identical, we will cordially co-operate with the rest of the South, in any measure of defence of our constitutional rights, that may be best calculated to preserve their integrity.</p>

<p>Whereas, it appears that the clerk of the Board of Land Commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions for Robertson county, has failed and neglected to male due returns to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, of the certificates issued by said board; and whereas, it further ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pears that the records of the board of Land Commissioners afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said, have been left in an imperfect and informal manner, inas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />much as said records do not exhibit the numbers and dates of the certificates, issued by said board, together with the quantities of land for which said certificates were issued; by reason of which neglect and informality in said records, returns cannot now be made in due form to the Commissioner of the General Land Of<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fice, of the certificates issued by said board; and whereas, by rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son of the neglect and informality aforesaid, many citizens to whom certificates were issued by said board have been prevented from receiving titles for the lands located and surveyed by virtue of said certificates, although (as would appear from the records of the board of Land Commissioners aforesaid,) said citizens have made all proof required of them by law, and are therefore justly entitled to the lands claimed by virtue of the certificates afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said; therefore,</p>

<p>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That whenever any person shall apply for a patent, by virtue of any certificate issued by the board of Land Commissioners for Robertson county, when the name of the party entitled and mentioned in the certificate, appears on the list of certificates returned to the General Land Office, and the list does not specify the number of the certificate, or the quantity of land to which the party was entitled, the applicant for a patent shall be entitled to the same, according to the provisions of law, upon filing with his application in the General Land Office, the affidavit of the party, to whom the certificate was granted, depos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing that the certificate was genuine, that the same was issued by the board of Land Commissioners for the county of Robertson, and that the said party is, in truth and justice, and under the laws of the land, entitled to the quantity of land specified in said certi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficate, in case the party to whom the certificate was granted, has departed this life, or his residence is unknown; then the heirs or legal representatives, or the assignee may file them in the same manner, and with the same effect, the affidavit of two respectable witnesses, stating the same facts as are required by the party to whom the certificate was issued, and that they know the party to whom the certificate was issued, and that his residence is unknown at the time of making the affidavit; provided that the provisions of this act shall not extend to any certificate issued by any board of Land Commissioners of Robertson county, previous to the first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two; and that this act be in force and take effect from and after its passage.</p>
